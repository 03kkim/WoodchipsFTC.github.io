      <p> We are the Woodchips! This year will be our third season competing in FTC and we couldn&#39;t be more excited! Our team is mainly comprised of ambitious lower-classmen, most of the team consists of freshmen and 8th graders. We have multiple experienced FLL team members that share their knowledge with the rest of the group, but we also have many intelligent new members that bring innovative ideas to the team. Even though our team is relatively new, we have a lot of talent and hope to have a promising season. Thanks to our team coach, Ms. Kuiken, and our excellent parent mentor, Mrs. Elliott, we hope to have a great season and to build a solid foundation for seasons to come. </p>
